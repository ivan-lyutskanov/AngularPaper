# AngularPaper

Demo how to integrate Paper.js into Angular project. Allows the user to draw on image and export the result.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

## Start the app

Run `yarn install` (npm will fail on Windows OS - unable to resolve paper.js deps!)

Use `npm start` for a dev server.
